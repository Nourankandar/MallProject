# OpenGL Legacy Mall Project

## Project Description
This project is a 3D shopping mall simulation built using OpenGL's legacy fixed-function pipeline. The application demonstrates basic 3D rendering techniques, lighting, and simple animations to create a virtual mall environment.

## Features
- 3D mall structure with multiple floors and stores
- Basic lighting implementation (ambient, diffuse)
- Simple camera navigation
- Texture mapping for storefronts and surfaces
- Basic animation for stairs
- Collision detection with walls and obstacles

## Requirements
- C++ compiler (GCC, MSVC, etc.)
- OpenGL libraries
- GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit) or FreeGLUT
- (Optional) GLM for mathematics operations
